Description:
When connecting to Timeplus, always use the direct proton driver connection pattern:

conn, err := proton.Open(&proton.Options{...})

followed by direct methods like conn.Exec() and conn.Query().

Never use database/sql interfaces with proton.OpenDB() for Timeplus connections as it can cause materialized view and query issues.
